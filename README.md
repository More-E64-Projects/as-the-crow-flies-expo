# About this project

As The Crow Flies (working title) is a mobile map based knowledge game.

## Who are we?

- We are a group of recent graduates from Codeclan in Edinburgh working on a small React Native game to improve our coding skills.
- Alex, Michael, Angel, Jen and Becky all from the E64 cohort of July 2023.
- Most of us are currenlty looking for our first junior developer roles within the tech industry.
- We decided to work on a personal project but with each other for accountability and fun as well as support.

## What is the idea?

After a lot of ideas discussed, we came up with a mobile game using maps and country APIs, where the player would be tested on their geography knowledge.

## Currently in development only

You will need to download either Xcode for MacOs or if you are happy to use your mobile device, get the Expo app from either the Apple or Android store.

To clone the repo to your personal machine please do the following:

- create a folder where you want to project to be saved.
- copy the HTTPS or SHH link then
- `git clone` 'url'
- then `cd frontend`
- type `npm i` to install all the dependancies
- finally `npm start`

If you are using Expo you can scan the QR code that your terminal shows to open the app or the Xcode emulator should show you the mobile screen on your computer.

You should see this on your screen:-
